With its medieval city center, Bern was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, but besides its historically buildings the city also offers a lot, small alleyways to explore, great restaurants and cultural activities. Surprisingly most people don’t think of Bern as being the capital city of Switzerland. The old town is half surrounded by the river Aare offering a place to swim in warm days. An amazing city that should be visited if you are traveling to Europe or Switzerland.  </p>
