                    <p class="align-center">I came to London with my friend. The flight lasted 3 hours, so before we even had time to look back, we found ourselves in a real British city, and not just an ordinary city, but London itself! We were released into the city completely calmly; it was enough to talk to the consul and explain the situation. We immediately rushed to the metro and bought two tickets to the city center. It costs 5 pounds to get to the center, it seems to me that this price is not at all low. Although the metro is very clean and cozy inside, there is a policeman on duty constantly to keep order. After we got to our stop, about 40 minutes passed. In general, we reached the famous Big Ben clock and were very amazed. On the way we passed some park where real swans swam! The clock itself is very unusual and interesting; in front of the clock there is another landmark of London Eye, but we decided not to go for a ride, and it was not that close to go there. The view of Big Ben was enough for my friend and I. We even waited for the clock to strike the time!</p>

                    <p class="align-center">Larnaca is a wonderful resort city where you can relax on the beaches, have fun at discos and don’t need to go to the sights too much - everything is close.
Among the interesting places you can visit the Church of St. Lazarus. For those who do not have a dress code for visiting church, there are skirts and capes hanging right there. The square is very nice, next to the church, where you can sit in a cozy cafe with a glass of wine for only 4 euros.
Not far from the city airport there is a salt lake. In summer it almost completely dries up, leaving only puddles, and closer to winter it fills with water and thousands of pink flamingos. As we were told, they have a stop here when they fly to warmer climes.
My wife and I went here for the first time, but now we will go regularly every year</p>

                    <p class="align-center">I love Dubai, although many people criticize that it is a desert, there is no greenery, a concrete jungle, everything is expensive!!! Anyone who thinks so, rightly, don’t come) but I like it) Of course, in the summer it’s very hot here, but there is air conditioning everywhere, hotels often have swimming pools with chilled water, but there are good discounts in cool hotels! There are many travel agencies in Dubai with multilingual guides; you can travel to all the emirates. There are many parks and greenery, and what a wonderful sea! I'm talking about the Arabian Gulf (Persian). You can go to the Indian Ocean in Fujairah or to the Ottoman Gulf, look at the fish, snorkeling, I met a big turtle!!! And some even small sharks! The best time to visit is March, April, sometimes May, November, December. There are a lot of interesting things and entertainment for every budget!</p>
